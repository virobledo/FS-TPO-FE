I am very grateful for all that I learned with these three courses where I have been able to enjoy his job. Whoever can take the opportunity to read his book, will understand these words very good, it is truly an excellent material not only for studying, but also to put into practice. My dear friend, teacher and colleague, thanks for placing so much dedication, so much passion into that which you love and for giving us the chance to be part of it ¡For much more success!'
